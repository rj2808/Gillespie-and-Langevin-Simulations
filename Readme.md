# Gillespie and Langevin Simulations in Python and Matlab
### For Learning go to gillespie A->B folder and check how gillespie is implemeted
### Langevin Simulations
	Check Langevin_miRNA.m
This Repo is to upload and share all the Langevin Simulations codes and results for modelling the mi-RNA regulation in the Gene Expression. Codes include Langevin Simulations and Gillespie Simulations on Gene Regulation Problem.
