# Gillespie and Langevin Simulations in Python and Matlab
### For Learning Gillespie
	Go to gillespie A->B folder and check how gillespie is implemeted in various ways
### Langevin Simulations
	Check Langevin_miRNA.m
#### Important
	Use python3 *.py to run the various programms
This Repo is to upload and share all the Langevin Simulations codes and results for modelling the mi-RNA regulation in the Gene Expression. Codes include Langevin Simulations and Gillespie Simulations on Gene Regulation Problem.
